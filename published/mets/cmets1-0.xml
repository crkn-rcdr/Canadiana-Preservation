    <description_rules>
        <p>
            MARC Records should follow standard cataloguing rules (i.e. AACR2 or RDA).
        </p>
        <p>
            Dublin Core records may use any of the standard DC elements. It is recommended to use the DC recommended guidelines
            best practices for usage. During the creation of internal data structures for access, these fields
            will be interpreted in specific ways:
        </p>
        <p>
            If there is one dc:date field, it will be treated as the date of publication. If there are two or more dc:date
            fields, the first two will be treated as the start and end of a publication date range. Additional
            dc:date fields are ignored. To guarantee the correct parsing of dates, they should be ISO 8601-compliant
            dates in one of the following formats: YYYY, YYYY-MM, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dc:language field(s) will be used to determine the language(s) of the document. ISO 639-3 language codes should
            be used. Other formats might not be parsed correctly.

    <structural_requirements>
        <metsHdr>
            <requirement>
                <p>The OBJID attribute must uniquely identify the object among all of the submitter's content. It
                    must be between 5 and 64 characters in length and consist only of ASCII alphanumeric characters
                    and the underscore (A-Za-z0-9_).
                </p>
            </requirement>
        </metsHdr>
        <dmdSec>
            <requirement>
                <p>There must be a &lt;dmdSec&gt; element for the main item (series, issue or monographic document).
                    If the item is a document (issue or monograph) it may also contain child &lt;dmdSec&gt; elements
                    for each page in the &lt;structMap&gt;.
                </p>
            </requirement>
            <requirement>
                <p>The content of each &lt;dmdSec&gt; element must be an inline record wrapped in an &lt;xmlData&gt;
                    element or an &lt;mdRef&gt; element The record format depends on the type of object it references:</p>
                <p>For series and monographic documents, it must be a MARCXML record or a Simple Dublin Core record.</p>
                <p>For issues, it must be an IssueInfo record.</p>
                <p>For components, there are legacy METS records that have txtmap records stored as a dmdSec. As of
                    this version of our proile, all Txtmap data is optional and will be stored as files rather
                    than described as metadata. A Txtmap in a dmdSec or in a file element will be treated as equivalent.</p>
            </requirement>
        </dmdSec>
        <amdSec>
            <requirement>
                <p>Items with components and associated files (documents or issues) may contain an amdSec for the
                    main item with techMD sections for each component.</p>
            </requirement>
            <requirement>
                <p>Each amdSec contains at least one techMD element. Each techMD element contains technical metadata
                    that corresponds to a file in the files directory of the containing Bagit archive.
                </p>
            </requirement>
            <requirement>
                <p>Each techMD element is provided an ADMID. This version of the profile supports the techMD sub-element
                    and the technical metadata file: JHOVE.
                </p>
            </requirement>
            <requirement>
                <p>Each techMD element contains an mdRef element referencing the location of the XML file containing
                    the administrative metadata. The MDTYPE attribute is set to "OTHER" and the OTHERMDTYPE attribute
                    set to the metadata scheme of the file. Other optional attributes are MIMETYPE and LABEL.</p>
            </requirement>
            <requirement>
                <!-->Upgrade to latest METS v2 will include example attributes: EXAMPLES="ex01"-->
                <p>For JHOVE files the following attributes are required: MIMETYPE, LOCTYPE, MDTYPE, OTHERMDTYPE,
                    xlink:href. See Example 1.</p>
            </requirement>
        </amdSec>
        <fileSec>
            <requirement>
                <p>
                    Series records will have one &lt;fileGrp&gt; with USE="canonical" while document records may also have &lt;fileGrp&gt;
                    elements with USE="master" and, optionally, USE="distribution".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The canonical &lt;fileGrp&gt; must contain a &lt;file&gt; element for the root document/series and for each page
                    (in a document) with an &lt;FLocat&gt; element with LOCTYPE="URL" and a href pointing to a
                    URL associated with that object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two ways of grouping files: by fileGrp use such as Master or Distribution or by their component representation
                    (for instance all files that refer to a page). The first option, by fileGrp use, is being deprecated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the files are grouped by use, the master images for each page in a document are placed in the master group and
                    the PDF of the document is placed in the distribution group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the files are grouped according to their referent, ie all manifestations of the component (eg a page of a volume
                    or issue) are grouped into the same fileGrp, the use of each file is indicated at the file
                    level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use is first determined at the file level. Each &lt;file&gt; element may have a USE attribute containing one of
                    the following values: "master" or "derivative". If a file element does not contain a USE attribute
                    then this information will be acquired from the parent fileGrp USE attribute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each file element must contain an FLocat element which specifies external location of the content file in its xlink:href
                    attribute.The FLocat element must contain an xlink:href attribute, as well as a LOCTYPE attribute
                    indicating the type of href being provided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The file element must also contain the following attributes: an ID for identifying this element and a MIMETYPE
                    for the data file being referenced. Other optional attributes include: SIZE, CREATED, CHECKSUM,
                    CHECKSUMTYPE.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An ADMID attribute on each file attribute points to the technical metadata for that file held within the amdSec.
                </p>
            </requirement>
        </fileSec>
        <structMap>
            <requirement>
                <p>
                    There must be a single &lt;structMap&gt; element with attribute TYPE="physical".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The root &lt;div&gt; element must have the attribute TYPE="document" for monographic documents, TYPE="series" for
                    a series metadata submission and TYPE="issue" for a document that is part of a series. Series
                    have no further &lt;div&gt; elements and must not have any &lt;fptr&gt; elements, as they are
                    metadata-only submissions. Documents and issues must have one &lt;div&gt; element for each
                    page they contain, appearing in sequential order. A document should include a &lt;fptr&gt;
                    to a distributable PDF version of the document as a whole, if one exists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each part of a document must be represented by a &lt;div&gt; with the attribute TYPE="page". If there is a master
                    image file for that page then it must contain a &lt;fptr&gt; which references the master image
                    file for that page. Note that a page in this context might not correspond to one physical page
                    of the original book (e.g. if the book was digitized with two facing pages for each image,
                    or if a large fold-out is split into multiple images). In some cases, such as with born-digital
                    content, there will not be a master image for each page, but one file for the entire object.
                    A &lt;fptr&gt; referencing the image file for each page is not required in these instances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each &lt;div&gt; element must contain a LABEL attribute to describe the item. For a series or monographic document,
                    it should be the common title of the item. For an issue, it should be the issue title without
                    the common series title (e.g., "vol. 5, issue 1 : January 1895"). For a page, it should be
                    the page number, sequence, or similar description (e.g. "p. 9" or "Front Cover").
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each &lt;div&gt; element must include a DMDID attribute which references the ID attribute of the corresponding
                    &lt;dmdSec&gt; element.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The mdRef and FLocat elements use the xlink:href attribute to point to external resources. For these elements the
                    attribute LOCTYPE can be set to "URI" or "URL". If set to URL, the path is relative to the
                    METS file, and includes the directory and corresponding name of the file as it appears in the
                    directory. If set to URI, and the element is FLocat, the files are located in the files directory.
                    If the element is mdRef then the files are located in the metadata directory.

                                    efforts to Improve the management of the Export and Investment Promotion Program,
                                    I am pleased to see that we are now able, In this Quarterly Trade Tracking
                                    Report, to display the progress being made by posts In the execution of the
                                    planned activities as outlined in the export and Investment promotion plans
                                    submitted by each post last fall. This review of progress will improve our
                                    ability to keep abreast of developments In your posts In a more disciplined
                                    fashion. This report will enable you and your officers to monitor the progress
                                    of program Implementation in your posts by comparing planned activities In
                                    priority sectors with quarterly activity highlights and results. It joins the
                                    Quarterly Results and Activity Report which has been, and will continue to
                                    be sent to you. On the whole I am pleased with the quality of the progress
                                    reports submitted by the posts. Sane missions have taken particular care to
                                    set out precise activity statements In their plans which have made their quarterly
                                    activity and results summaries In this report very effective program evaluation
                                    tools. I vculd hope that those posts who have not yet Indicated a carmencement
                                    of their planned activities will be more forthcoming in their next report.
                                    Our ability to continue to defend and build upon our current level of trade
                                    and Investment resources abroad will be Increasingly dependent upon the reliability
                                    of Information your posts provide to identify their activities, workload and
                                    results which the tracking system was designed In part to accomplish. 7, G.E.

                                    investissements, ncus sarnies maintenant en mesure, dans le présent rapport
                                    trimestriel sur les activités et les résultats, d'indiquer les progrès accomplis
                                    par chacune des missions dans la réalisation des activités prévues dans les
                                    plans de promotion des exportations et des Investissements qu'elles ont présentés
                                    l'automne dernier. En raison de cet examen des progrès, nous serons mieux en
                                    mesure de nous tenir au courant, de façon plus disciplinée, des développements
                                    qui surviennent dans vos missions. Grâce au rapport, vos agents et vous pourrez
                                    comparer les activités prévues dans les secteurs prioritaires aux activités
                                    qui se sont déroulées et aux résultats qui ont-été obtenus au cours d'un trimestre
                                    et, par conséquent, surveiller les progrès réalisés en ce qui concerne la mise
                                    en oeuvre du programme dans vos missions. Ce rapport s'ajoute au Rapport trimestriel
                                    sur les activités et les résultats qui vous a été envoyé jusqu'ici et qui continuera

                                    rapports d'étape qu'ont présentés les missions. Certaines missions ont pris
                                    bien soin d'établir des énoncés d'activités précis dans leurs plans, ce qui
                                    fait des résumés trimestriels sur les activités et les résultats que renferme
                                    le rapport susmentionné des eut Ils très efficaces d'évaluation du programme.
                                    J'ose espérer que les missions qui n'ont pas encore signalé avoir entrepris
                                    les activités qu'elles avaient prévues se montreront plus coimunlcatives dans

                                <t>AVIS IMPORTANT IMPORTANT Nous avons voulu donner à ce nouveau rapport une présentation
                                    qui soit aussi lisible que possible et rectifier quelques irrégularités et
                                    problèmes liés à 1'entrée des données et aux réponses présentées par les missions,
                                    ce qui a retardé la publication de la première édit ion. Vous remarquerez que
                                    dans les pages suivantes, nombre de sections devant contenir les données des
                                    missions ont été laissées en blanc. C'est parce que celles-ci n'ont pas fait
                                    rapport de leurs activités trimestrielles dans les secteurs qu'elles ont identifiés
                                    dans leur plan comme étant des secteurs prioritaires (voir page 30 du Guide
                                    et les instructions sur le formulaire 'Rapport des activités et des résultats'
                                    , sous la rubrique "Activités de promotion des exportations"). Autrement dit,
                                    le système est programmé uniquement pour comparer les activités et les résultats
                                    trimestriels avec les activités prioritaires énoncées dans le plan annuel de
                                    la mission. Un certain nombre de missions ont présenté des rapports d'activités
                                    trimestrielles pour des secteurs autres que ceux qui ont été identifiés dans
                                    leur plan annuel, de sorte qu'il devient impossible à leur Direction générale
                                    de surveiller les activités prioritaires planifiées pour la période. The first
                                    edition of this new report has been delayed by efforts to configure the report
                                    in as readable a format as possible and to deal with some anomalies and teething
                                    problems associated with mission responses and data entry. Readers will note
                                    that many of the sections for post inputs on the following pages are blank.
                                    This is a result of missions not providing quarterly activities on the sectors
                                    they identified in their plans as being their post priorities (see guide page
                                    30 ; see Tracking report form instructions under "Export Promotion Activities).
                                    Put another way, the system is programmed only to compare quarterly activities
                                    and results with priority activities outlined in the post annual Plan. A number
                                    ,of posts provided quarterly activities statements for sectors other than those
                                    they identified in their annual plan, thereby making it impossible for their
                                    bureaux to monitor their intended priority activities. For this first report
                                    only, the actual activities reported by posts who did not conform' to instructions
                                    have been included as section 2 as an indication that those posts in fact submitted
                                    quarterly activity reports. Future editions of this report will also include
                                    "Special Activities in Export and Investment Promotion Program" as submitted
                                    by posts in their quarterly tracking eports. As well future editions will be
                                    published within hirty days of the cut off date for the submission of quarterly
                                    reports by missions. L, Pour ce premier rapport seulement, nous avons présenté,
                                    dans la section 2, les activités réelles dont ont fait rapport les missions,
                                    contrairement aux instructions, afin d'indiquer qu'elles ont effectivement
                                    présenté des rapports d'activités trimestrielles. JJ La section "Activités

                                    telle que présentée par les missions dans leur Rapport des activités et des
                                    résultats, figurera dans les éditions ultérieures. En outre, celles-ci seront
