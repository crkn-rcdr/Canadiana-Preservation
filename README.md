# CRKN digital preservation system

The Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN) maintains a preservation platform.  As of 2018 it is using a custom platform that was created by Canadiana staff when it was a separate organization, but the plan is to adopt existing software such as Archivematica and OpenStack Swift.

This git project will provide documentation for the preservation platform, and the related GitHub project will provide a forum for discussing its future. If you have questions about CRKN's preservation, please create them as issues withinn this repository.
