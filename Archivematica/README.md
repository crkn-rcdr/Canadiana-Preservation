# CRKN's use of Archivematica

In 2018 CRKN, with the support of the Preservation and Access Committee, confirmed the decision that Canadiana had made earlier to transition from a custom OAIS packaging system to Archivematica.

In parallel with the packaging system work, CRKN will be moving away from custom software built on top of ZFS to using OpenStack Swift.

## Simplified steps

* Use Archivematica Storage Service for replication ([Issue #1](https://github.com/crkn-rcdr/Digital-Preservation/issues/1)) and validation (Fixity - [Issue #2](https://github.com/crkn-rcdr/Digital-Preservation/issues/2)) on existing Canadiana format AIPs
* Enhance Canadiana's Access Platform to support DIPs generated by Archivematica
* Temporarily add support for generating DIPs from Canadiana AIPs similar to Archivematica DIPs, so Access Platform can support DIPs from both systems
* Design and execute project to migrate AIPs from Canadiana packaging format to Archivematica's packaging format
* Decomission Canadiana packaging system

We will be making use of GitHub's issue tracking system for discussion with the wider community, and using this source repository for documentation.


### Transforming Canadiana AIPs into structure used by Archivematica

There are several similarities between how Canadiana stores files within packages and how Archivematica does.

* Both use [BagIt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt)
* Both use [METS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_Encoding_and_Transmission_Standard)
* The file formats which Canadiana preserves is a subset of what Archivematica can preserve

Some discussion, policy decisions, and planning will be required for differences.

* Canadiana AIPs can encapsulate the files of multiple SIPs (See: [Issue #3](https://github.com/crkn-rcdr/Digital-Preservation/issues/3))
* Canadiana stores full METS records whenever descriptive metadata is updated (See: [Issue #4](https://github.com/crkn-rcdr/Digital-Preservation/issues/4))
* Canadiana has made use of PrimeOCR and Abbyy Recognition Server to generate XML and PDF files (See: [Issue #5](https://github.com/crkn-rcdr/Digital-Preservation/issues/5))
* Canadiana uses 3 different formats for archival descriptive metadata, while Archivematica only uses Dublin Core (See: [Issue #6](https://github.com/crkn-rcdr/Digital-Preservation/issues/6))
* Older Canadiana processes caused the ingest of duplicate data, and we may want to deduplicate as part of the transformation (See: [Issue #7](https://github.com/crkn-rcdr/Digital-Preservation/issues/7))
* If the transformation should be lossless, how should we encode other information (past METS records and changelog.txt)
