# CRKN's use of Archivematica

In 2018 CRKN, with the support of the Preservation and Access Committee, confirmed the decision that Canadiana had made earlier to transition from a custom OAIS packaging system to Archivematica.

In parallel with the packaging system work, CRKN will be moving away from custom software built on top of ZFS to using OpenStack Swift.

## Simplified steps

* Use Archivematica Storage Service for replication ([Issue #1](https://github.com/crkn-rcdr/Digital-Preservation/issues/1)) and validation (Fixity - [Issue #2](https://github.com/crkn-rcdr/Digital-Preservation/issues/2)) on existing Canadiana format AIPs
* Enhance Canadiana's Access Platform to support DIPs generated by Archivematica
* Temporarily add support for generating DIPs from Canadiana AIPs similar to Archivematica DIPs, so Access Platform can support DIPs from both systems
* Design and execute project to migrate AIPs from Canadiana packaging format to Archivematica's packaging format
* Decomission Canadiana packaging system

We will be making use of GitHub's issue tracking system for discussion with the wider community, and using this source repository for documentation.
